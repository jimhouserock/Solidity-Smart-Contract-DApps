/** Business Purpose: 
The purpose of this contract is to create a non-fungible token (NFT) on the Ethereum blockchain 
that can be minted by users for a fixed price. 
The contract ensures that users can only mint one token per wallet, 
and that the total supply of tokens does not exceed a predetermined maximum. 
The contract also includes functions for enabling and disabling minting, 
changing the maximum supply, and withdrawing funds. 
The NFT can be used for various purposes such as digital art, gaming, and collectibles.
